                    Ready player one is a fantastic depiction of what the world could look like in the future if our virtual reality gear and overall technology took a few more steps forward. Nearly everyone in this story has some sort of gaming system, and regularly joins the virtual world called “the Oasis”. The way that the author, Earnest Cline depicts this massive universe is quite beautiful. The oasis is where people work, go to school, and live. Something interesting that has stuck with me ever since reading ready player one is that our main character Parzival doesn't know the true identity of his best friend, Aech. I will try to leave minimal spoilers, but when he eventually meets Aech in real life he was surprised. That part of the novel stuck with me because of how I frequent many online games and communicate with many people who I know nothing about, even though my mind assigns a face and voice that may not even be close to reality. My favorite part of the book has to be the world building. It would be so insane to have a game world as massive and complex as the oasis, but unfortunately it just seems technologically impossible in this day and age. This is my favorite book. 10/10

                    I was SO excited when I first found out that Ready Player One was going to be made into a live action movie. My favorite book finally transformed and put on the big screen. So, was the movie an accurate representation of the book? I would say yes, mostly. Probably 90% accurate. One thing that was not accurate but in fact built on this massive world of the oasis was the way they included so many video game characters and movie characters into this movie. The book didn't really mention things like this. For example, the character Tracer from the video game Overwatch can be seen roaming around the world of the oasis in one scene. I really found this touch to be a positive addition to the movie, as the book couldn't really go into every tiny detail of everyone's player model and things like that. The plot does shift a tiny bit from what I remember, but overall does not ruin it for me. It would seem just right to someone who has not read the book before watching. As of now, the author has written a sequel to the book, named Ready Player Two, however I have not read it. Will they make a sequel movie as well? I'm not sure. It kind of seems like the first book and movie left off at a hood stopping point, but maybe there is something more to be done there.
